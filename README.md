Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?
For this my client was Artemis Financial and the issue the company wanted me to address was they wanted me to fix their software security so it would be safe for their users.
What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?
When I found the vulnerabilities I was able to patch and restart to make sure everything was working correctly. It is important to code securely because it protects the data. The value that software security add overall is just making sure what is being pu out is safe and secure fr the people that are using what we are putting out.
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The part of the assesment that was hard for me was making sure that I was patching everything correctly.
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
I increased layers of security by enabling HTTPS. In the future I would use scanning tools.
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I made certain the code was functional/secure by testing it to make sure it worked. I check to see new vulnerabilites by running checksum tests.
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
My biggest resourse was my professor and the help I was provided. The diagram also helped but I wouldn't have made it this far without my professor's support and help.
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
From this assignment, I would show how I was able to find and fixed vulnerabilities and keep everything functional in the app.
